# Lecture 21: Authentication and Passwords

### 11.2.1 Separating Trust from Authenticating Principals

Authentication consists of reliably identifying the principal associated with a request. Authentication can be provided by technical means such as passwords and signing messages. The technical means create a chain of evidence that securely connects an incoming request with a principal, perhaps by establishing that a message came from the same principal as a previous message. The technical means may even be able to establish the real world identity of the principal.

### 11.2.2 Authenticating Principals

Most authentication systems follow this model: the sender tells the guard its principal identity, and the guard verifies that claim. This verification protocol has two stages:

1. A rendezvous step, in which a real-world person physically visits an authority that configures the guard. The authority checks the identity of the real-world person, creates a principal identifier for the person, and agrees on a method by which the guard can later identify the principal identifier for the person. One must be particularly cautious in checking the real-world identity of a principal because an adversary may be able to fake it.
2. A verification of identity, which occurs at various later times. The sender presents a claimed principal identifier and the guard uses the agreed-upon method to verify the claimed principal identifier. If the guard is able to verify the claimed principal identifier, then the source is authenticated. If not, the guard disallows access and raises an alert.

### 11.2.3  Cryptographic Hash Functions, Computationally Secure, Window of Validity

The most commonly employed method for verifying identities in computer systems is based on passwords because it has a convenient user interface; users can just type in their name and password on a keyboard. However, there are several weaknesses in this approach. One weakness is that the stored copy of the password becomes an attractive target for adversaries. One way to remove this weakness is to store a cryptographic hash of the password in the password file of the system, rather than the password itself.

A cryptographic hash function maps an arbitrary-sized array of bytes M to a fixed-length value V, and has the following properties:

1. For a given input M, it is easy to compute V ‚Üê H(M), where H is the hash function;
2. It is difficult to compute M knowing only V;
3. It is difficult to find another input M' such that H(M') = H(M);
4. The computed value V is as short as possible, but long enough that H has a low probability of collision: the probability of two different inputs hashing to the same value V must be so low that one can neglect it in practice. A typical size for V is 160 to 256 bits.

Given that d(technology)/dt is so high in computer systems and cryptography is a fast developing field, it is good practice to consider the window of validity for a specific cryptographic function. The window of validity of a cryptographic function is the minimum of the time-to-compromise of all of its components. The window of validity for cryptographic hash functions is the minimum of the time to compromise the hash algorithm and the time to find a message M' such that for a given M, H(M') = H(M). The window of validity of a password-based authentication system is the minimum of the window of validity of the hashing algorithm, the time to try all possible passwords, and the time to compromise a password.

### 11.2.4 Using Cryptographic Hash Functions to Protect Passwords

In general, it is advisable to minimize repeated use of a secret because each exposure increases the chance that the adversary may discover the secret. To minimize exposure, any security scheme based on passwords should use them only once per session with a particular service: to verify the identity of a person at the first access. After the first access, one should use a newly-generated, strong secret for further accesses. More generally, what we need is a protocol between the user and the service that has the following properties:

1. it authenticates the principal to the guard;
2. the password never travels over the network so that adversaries cannot learn the password by eavesdropping on network traffic;
3. the password is used only once per session so that the protocol exposes this secret as few times as possible. This has the additional advantage that the user must type the password only once per session.
