# Lecture 15: Fault Tolerance: Introduction to Transactions

# Overview

    The single conceptual framework of atomicity provides a powerful way of thinking about both all or-nothing failure masking and before-or-after sequencing of concurrent activities. Atomicity is the performing of a sequence of steps, called actions, so that they appear to be done as a single, indivisible step, known in operating system and architecture literature as an atomic action and in database management literature as a transaction. When a fault causes a failure in the middle of a correctly designed atomic action, it will appear to the invoker of the atomic action that the atomic action either completed successfully or did nothing at all‚Äîthus an atomic action provides all-or nothing atomicity. Similarly, when several atomic actions are going on concurrently, each atomic action will appear to take place either completely before or completely after every other atomic action‚Äîthus an atomic action provides before-or-after atomicity. Together, all-or-nothing atomicity and before-or-after atomicity provide a particularly strong form of modularity: they hide the fact that the atomic action is actually composed of multiple steps.

    The result is a sweeping simplification in the description of the possible states of a system. This simplification provides the basis for a methodical approach to recovery from failures and coordination of concurrent activities that simplifies design, simplifies understanding for later maintainers, and simplifies verification of correctness. These desiderata are particularly important because errors caused by mistakes in coordination usually depend on the relative timing of external events and among different threads. When a timing-dependent error occurs, the difficulty of discovering and diagnosing it can be orders of magnitude greater than that of finding a mistake in a purely sequential activity. The reason is that even a small number of concurrent activities can have a very large number of potential real time sequences. It is usually impossible to determine which of those many potential sequences of steps preceded the error, so it is effectively impossible to reproduce the error under more carefully controlled circumstances. Since debugging this class of error is so hard, techniques that ensure correct coordination a priori are particularly valuable.

    The remarkable thing is that the same systematic approach‚Äîatomicity‚Äîto failure recovery also applies to coordination of concurrent activities. In fact, since one must be able to deal with failures while at the same time coordinating concurrent activities, any attempt to use different strategies for these two problems requires that the strategies be compatible. Being able to use the same strategy for both is another sweeping simplification.

    Atomic actions are a fundamental building block that is widely applicable in computer system design. Atomic actions are found in database management systems, in register management for pipelined processors, in file systems, in change-control systems used for program development, and in many everyday applications such as word processors and calendar managers.

## 9.1 Atomicity

Atomicity is a property required in several different areas of computer system design. These areas include managing a database, developing a hardware architecture, specifying the interface to an operating system, and more generally in software engineering.

### 9.1.1 All-or-Nothing Atomicity in a Database

### 9.1.2 All-or-Nothing Atomicity in the Interrupt Interface

### 9.1.3 All-or-Nothing Atomicity in a Layered Application

<aside>
üí°                                      <center>All-or-nothing atomicity</center>
A sequence of steps is an all-or-nothing action if, from the point of view of its invoker, the sequence always either
    ‚Ä¢ completes,
or
    ‚Ä¢ aborts in such a way that it appears that the sequence had never been undertaken in     the first place. That is, it backs out.

</aside>

In a layered application, the idea is to design each of the actions of each layer to be all-or-nothing. That is, whenever an action of a layer is carried out by a sequence of actions of the next lower layer, the action either completes what it was asked to do or else it backs out, acting as though it had not been invoked at all. When control returns to a higher layer after a lower layer detects a fault, the problem of being ‚Äúin the middle‚Äù of an action thus disappears.

### 9.1.4 Some Actions With and Without the All-or-Nothing Property

    If every instruction is an all-or-nothing action, the operating system can simply save as the value of the next-instruction pointer the address of the instruction that encountered the missing page. The resulting saved state description shows that the program is between two instructions, one of which has been completely executed, and the next one of which has not yet begun.

    A second example is the supervisor call (SVC). Section 5.3.4 pointed out that the SVC instruction, which changes both the program counter and the processor mode bit (and in systems with virtual memory, other registers such as the page map address register), needs to be all-or-nothing, to ensure that all (or none) of the intended registers change. Beyond that, the SVC invokes some complete kernel procedure. The designer would like to arrange that the entire call, (the combination of the SVC instruction and the operation of the kernel procedure itself) be an all-or thing action. An all-or-nothing design allows the application programmer to view the kernel procedure as if it is an extension of the hardware. That goal is easier said than done, since the kernel procedure may detect some condition that prevents it from carrying out the intended action. Careful design of the kernel procedure is thus required.

### 9.1.5 Before-or-After Atomicity: Coordinating Concurrent Threads

<aside>
üí° Before-or-after atomicity
Concurrent actions have the before-or-after property if their effect from the point of view of their invokers is the same as if the actions occurred either completely before or completely after one another.

</aside>

### 9.1.6 Correctness and Serialization

<aside>
üí° serializable: there exists some serial order of those concurrent transactions that would, if followed, lead to the same ending state.

</aside>

### 9.1.7 All-or-Nothing and Before-or-After Atomicity

<aside>
üí° Atomicity
An action is atomic if there is no way for a higher layer to discover the internal structure of its implementation.

</aside>

    This description is really the fundamental definition of atomicity. From it, one can immediately draw two important consequences, corresponding to all-or-nothing atomicity and to before-or-after atomicity:

1. From the point of view of a procedure that invokes an atomic action, the atomic action always appears either to complete as anticipated, or to do nothing. This consequence is the one that makes atomic actions useful in recovering from failures.
2. From the point of view of a concurrent thread, an atomic action acts as though it occurs either completely before or completely after every other concurrent atomic action. This consequence is the one that makes atomic actions useful for coordinating concurrent threads.

    There is one more aspect of hiding the internal structure of atomic actions: atomic actions can have benevolent side effects. A common example is an audit log, where atomic actions that run into trouble record the nature of the detected failure and the recovery sequence for later analysis. One might think that when a failure leads to backing out, the audit log should be rolled back, too; but rolling it back would defeat its purpose‚Äîthe whole point of an audit log is to record details about the failure. The important point is that the audit log is normally a private record of the layer that implemented the atomic action; in the normal course of operation it is not visible above that layer, so there is no requirement to roll it back.

## 9.2 All-or-Nothing Atomicity I: Concepts

bootstrapping means to first look for a systematic way to reduce a general problem to some much narrowed particular version of that same problem. Then, solve the narrow problem using some specialized method that might work only for that case because it takes advantage of the specific situation. The general solution then consists of two parts: a special-case technique plus a method  that systematically reduces the general problem to the special case.

### 9.2.2 Systematic Atomicity: Commit and the Golden Rule

The all-or-nothing action is thus divided into two phases, a pre-commit phase, commit point and a post-commit phase.

    The pre-commit phase must identify all the resources needed to complete the all-or-nothing action, and establish their availability. The names of data should be bound, permissions should be checked, the pages to be read or written should be in memory, removable media should be mounted, stack space must be allocated, etc. In other words, all the steps needed to anticipate the severe run-to the-end-without-faltering requirement of the post-commit phase should be completed during the pre-commit phase. In addition, the pre-commit phase must maintain the ability to abort at any instant. Any changes that the pre-commit phase makes to the state of the system must be undoable in case this all-or-nothing action aborts. Usually, this requirement means that shared resources, once reserved, cannot be released until the commit point is passed. The reason is that if an all-or-nothing action releases a shared resource, some other, concurrent thread may capture that resource. If the resource is needed in order to undo some effect of the all-or nothing action, releasing the resource is tantamount to abandoning the ability to abort. Finally, the reversibility requirement means that the all-or-nothing action should not do anything externally visible, for example printing a check or firing a missile, prior to the commit point.
    In contrast, the post-commit phase can expose results, it can release reserved resources that are no longer needed, and it can perform externally visible actions such as printing a check, opening a cash drawer, or drilling a hole. But it cannot try to acquire additional resources because an attempt to acquire might fail, and the post-commit phase is not permitted the luxury of failure. The post commit phase must confine itself to finishing just the activities that were planned during the pre commit phase.

    An important feature of the post-commit phase is that it is hidden inside the layer that implements the all-or-nothing action, so a scheme that ensures that the post-commit phase completes after a system failure is acceptable, so long as this delay is hidden from the invoking layer.

    Some all-or-nothing atomicity schemes thus involve a guarantee that a cleanup procedure will be  invoked following every system failure, or as a prelude to the next use of the data, before anyone in a higher layer gets a chance to discover that anything went wrong
