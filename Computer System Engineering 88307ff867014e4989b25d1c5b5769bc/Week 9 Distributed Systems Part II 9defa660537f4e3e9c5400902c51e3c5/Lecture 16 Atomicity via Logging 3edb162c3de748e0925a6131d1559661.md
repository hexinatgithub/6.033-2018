# Lecture 16: Atomicity via Logging

## 9.3 All-or-Nothing Atomicity II: Pragmatics

    Database management applications such as airline reservation systems or banking systems usually require high performance as well as all-or-nothing atomicity, so their designers use streamlined atomicity techniques. The foremost of these techniques sharply separates the reading and writing of data from the failure recovery mechanism. The idea is to minimize the number of storage accesses required for the most common activities (application reads and updates). The trade-off is that the number of storage accesses for rarely performed activities (failure recovery, which one hopes is actually exercised only occasionally, if at all) may not be minimal. The technique is called logging.

### 9.3.1 Atomicity Logs

    The basic idea behind atomicity logging is to combine the all-or-nothing atomicity of journal storage with the speed of cell storage, by having the application twice record every change to data. The application first logs the change in journal storage, and then it installs the change in cell storage.

    The first recording, to journal storage, is optimized for fast writing by creating a single, interleaved version history of all variables, known as a log. The information describing each data update forms a record that the application appends to the end of the log. Since there is only one log, a single pointer to the end of the log is all that is needed to find the place to append the record of a change of any variable in the system. If the log medium is magnetic disk, and the disk is used only for logging, and the disk storage management system allocates sectors contiguously, the disk seek arm will need to move only when a disk cylinder is full, thus eliminating most seek delays. As we will see, recovery does involve scanning the log, which is expensive, but recovery should be a rare event. Using a log is thus an example of following the hint to optimize for the common case.

    The second recording, to cell storage, is optimized to make reading fast: the application installs by simply overwriting the previous cell storage record of that variable. The record kept in cell storage can be thought of as a cache that, for reading, bypasses the effort that would be otherwise be required to locate the latest version in the log. In addition, by not reading from the log the logging diskâ€™s seek arm can remain in position, ready for the next update.

    The underlying idea is that the log is the authoritative record of the outcome of the action. Cell storage is merely a reference copy; if it is lost, it can be reconstructed from the log. The purpose of installing a copy in cell storage is to make both logging and reading faster. By recording data twice, we obtain high performance in writing, high performance in reading, and all-or-nothing atomicity, all at the same time.

### 9.3.2 Logging Protocols

    The reason is that logging appends but installing overwrites. If an application violates this protocol by installing an update before logging it and then for some reason must abort, or the system crashes, there is no systematic way to discover the installed update and, if necessary, reverse it. The write-ahead-log protocol ensures that if a crash occurs, a recovery procedure can, by consulting the log, systematically find all completed and intended changes to cell storage and either restore those records to old values or set them to new values, as appropriate to the circumstance.

    The basic element of an atomicity log is the log record. Before an action that is to be all-or-nothing installs a data value, it appends to the end of the log a new record of type CHANGE containing, in the general case, three pieces of information:

1. The identity of the all-or-nothing action that is performing the update.
2. A component action that, if performed, installs the intended value in cell storage. This component action is a kind of an insurance policy in case the system crashes. If the all-or nothing action commits, but then the system crashes before the action has a chance to perform the install, the recovery procedure can perform the install on behalf of the action. Some systems call this component action the do action, others the redo action.
3. A second component action that, if performed, reverses the effect on cell storage of the planned install. This component action is known as the undo action because if, after doing the install, the all-or-nothing action aborts or the system crashes, it may be necessary for the recovery procedure to reverse the effect of (undo) the install.

    An application appends a log record by invoking the lower-layer procedure LOG, which itself must be atomic. The LOG procedure is another example of bootstrapping: Starting with, for example, the ALL_OR_NOTHING_PUT described earlier in this chapter, a log designer creates a generic LOG procedure, and using the LOG procedure an application programmer then can implement all-or nothing atomicity for any properly designed composite action.

    Because the log is the authoritative record of the action, the all-or-nothing action can perform installs to cell storage at any convenient time that is consistent with the write-ahead-log protocol, either before or after logging the OUTCOME record.

### 9.3.3 Recovery Procedures

    The simplest recovery procedure performs two passes through the log. On the first pass, it scans the log backward from the last record, so the first evidence it will encounter of each all-or-nothing action is the last record that the all-or-nothing action logged. A backward log scan is sometimes called a LIFO (for last-in, first-out) log review. As the recovery procedure scans backward, it collects in a set the identity and completion status of every all-or-nothing action that logged an OUTCOME record before the crash. These actions, whether committed or aborted, are known as winners.

    When the backward scan is complete the set of winners is also complete, and the recovery procedure begins a forward scan of the log. The reason the forward scan is needed is that restarting after the crash completely reset the cell storage. During the forward scan the recovery procedure performs, in the order found in the log, all of the REDO actions of every winner whose OUTCOME record says that it COMMITTED. Those REDOs reinstall all committed values in cell storage, so at the end of this scan, the recovery procedure has restored cell storage to a desirable state. This state is as if every all-or-nothing action that committed before the crash had run to completion, while every all-or-nothing action that aborted or that was still pending at crash time had never existed. The database system can now open for regular business.

    This recovery procedure emphasizes the point that a log can be viewed as an authoritative version of the entire database, sufficient to completely reconstruct the reference copy in cell storage.

    A critical design property of the recovery procedure is that, if there should be another system crash during recovery, it must still be possible to recover. Moreover, it must be possible for any number of crash-restart cycles to occur without compromising the correctness of the ultimate result. The method is to design the recovery procedure to be idempotent. That is, design it so that if it is interrupted and restarted from the beginning it will produce exactly the same result as if it had run to completion to begin with.

    The ABORT procedure similarly needs to be idempotent because if an all-or-nothing action decides to abort and, while running ABORT, some timer expires, the system may decide to terminate and call ABORT for that same all-or-nothing action.

### 9.3.4 Other Logging Configurations: Non-Volatile Cell Storage

We can summarize the procedures for atomicity logging as follows:

- Log to journal storage before installing in cell storage (WAL protocol)
- If all-or-nothing actions perform all installs to non-volatile storage before logging their OUTCOME record, then recovery needs only to undo the installs of incomplete uncommitted actions. (rollback/undo recovery)
- If all-or-nothing actions perform no installs to non-volatile storage before logging their OUTCOME record, then recovery needs only to redo the installs of incomplete committed actions. (roll-forward/redo recovery)
- If all-or-nothing actions are not disciplined about when they do installs to nonvolatile storage, then recovery needs to both redo the installs of incomplete committed actions and undo the installs of incomplete uncommitted ones.

### 9.3.5 Checkpoints

    Suppose, for example, that the logging system maintains in volatile memory a list of identifiers of all-or-nothing actions that have started but have not yet recorded an END record, together with their pending/committed/aborted status, keeping it up to date by observing logging calls. The logging system then occasionally logs this list as a CHECKPOINT record. When a crash occurs sometime later, the recovery procedure begins a LIFO log scan as usual, collecting the sets of completed actions and losers. When it comes to a CHECKPOINT record it can immediately fill out the set of losers by adding those all-or-nothing actions that were listed in the checkpoint that did not later log an END record. This list may include some all-or-nothing actions listed in the  CHECKPOINT record as COMMITTED, but that did not log an END record by the time of the crash. Their installs still need to be performed, so they need to be added to the set of losers. The LIFO scan continues, but only until it has found the BEGIN record of every loser.

    With the addition of CHECKPOINT records, the recovery procedure becomes more complex, but is potentially shorter in time and effort:

1. Do a LIFO scan of the log back to the last CHECKPOINT record, collecting identifiers of losers and undoing all actions they logged.
2. Complete the list of losers from information in the checkpoint.
3. Continue the LIFO scan, undoing the actions of losers, until every BEGIN record belonging to every loser has been found.
4. Perform a forward scan from that point to the end of the log, performing any committed actions belonging to all-or-nothing actions in the list of losers that logged an OUTCOME record with status COMMITTED.

    Checkpoints are also used with in-memory databases, to provide durability without the need to reprocess the entire log after every system crash. A useful checkpoint procedure for an in-memory database is to make a snapshot of the complete database, writing it to one of two alternating (for all-or-nothing atomicity) dedicated non-volatile storage regions, and then logging a CHECKPOINT record that contains the address of the latest snapshot. Recovery then involves scanning the log back to the most recent CHECKPOINT record, collecting a list of committed all-or-nothing actions, restoring the snapshot described there, and then performing redo actions of those committed actions from the CHECKPOINT record to the end of the log. The main challenge in this scenario is dealing with update activity that is concurrent with the writing of the snapshot.
